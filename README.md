## C64 Origins Theme

This is a RetroPie/EmulationStation theme created to match the colours and blocky font of the Commodore 64 BASIC mode. 

Originally inspired by the Chicuelo theme, the C64 Origins theme has been thoroughly reworked to include new features such as a game details section and brand new wallpapers for every system, while also featuring new colours & fonts based on the original C64 BASIC boot screen.

### Theme Notes

This theme supports video. You can also use a scraped image in conjunction with the video. If you scrape both, when a game is selected, it will show the screenshot for a couple of seconds before fading and playing the video.

Game screenshots are not included within the theme. You can scrape your own - you should use game boxart/screenshots and/or videos.
