## C64 Origins / Chicuelo Remix Theme

This is a RetroPie theme created to match the colours and blocky font of the Commodore 64 BASIC mode. 

Originally based on the amazing [Chicuelo theme](https://github.com/chicueloarcade/es-theme-Chicuelo), the C64 Origins theme has been reworked to include a game details section as well as new wallpapers for every system, while featuring the classic C64 font and colours.

### Theme Notes

This theme supports video. You can also use a scraped image in conjunction with the video. If you scrape both, when a game is selected, it will show the screenshot for a couple of seconds before fading and playing the video.

Game screenshots are not included within the theme. You can scrape your own - you should use game boxart/screenshots and/or videos.
